# Simple React Weather App

App uses [OpenWeatherAPI](https://openweathermap.org/api) for weather data.

If you want to run it yourself, you need to get an API key from OpenWeatherAPI

Create .env file and inside the file insert your API key like this:
`VITE_WEATHER_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY`

Then install all packages
`npm install`

Run the app
`npm dev`
